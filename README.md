# 🛡️ Zero-Harm: AI-Powered Industrial Safety Intelligence

> **ET AI Hackathon 2026**
>
> An AI-powered Industrial Safety Intelligence platform that predicts and prevents industrial accidents using compound risk detection, real-time data fusion, and geospatial safety analytics. The system correlates gas sensors, work permits, maintenance activities, and worker locations to identify hazardous situations before incidents occur.

---

## 📖 Overview

Industrial facilities generate large volumes of data from different safety systems. However, these systems often work independently, making it difficult to identify risks that arise from multiple events occurring simultaneously.

**Zero-Harm** bridges this gap by combining data from multiple industrial sources into a unified AI-powered safety intelligence platform. Instead of monitoring individual sensors, the platform performs compound risk analysis to detect hazardous situations early and recommend preventive actions.

## 🧠 How It Works

The platform continuously collects data from multiple industrial sources:

- Gas sensor readings
- Hot-work permits
- Confined-space permits
- Maintenance activities
- Worker locations

Each source is independently analyzed and then combined using a Compound Risk Detection Engine to calculate a real-time risk score. When multiple hazardous conditions occur together, the platform generates explainable alerts along with recommended preventive actions.

## 📊 Risk Levels

| Risk Score | Level | Recommended Action |
|------------|-------|-------------------|
| 0–19 | 🟢 Low | Continue Monitoring |
| 20–44 | 🟡 Moderate | Notify Supervisor |
| 45–69 | 🟠 High | Suspend Hazardous Activities |
| 70–100 | 🔴 Critical | Evacuate Area & Dispatch Emergency Response |
